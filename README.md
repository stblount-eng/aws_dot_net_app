## Deployment Guide: Deploying Infrastructure with Terraform

### Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the infrastructure using Terraform. The infrastructure includes AWS resources such as EC2 instances, RDS instances, IAM roles, and policies.

### Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the deployment, ensure you have the following:
- AWS account with appropriate permissions to create resources.
- Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download it from the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- AWS CLI installed and configured with the necessary credentials.

### Steps to Deploy
Follow these steps to deploy the infrastructure:

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository containing the Terraform configuration files to your local machine.

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**: Ensure that your AWS credentials are configured either through environment variables or AWS CLI configuration.

3. **Initialize Terraform**: Navigate to the directory containing the Terraform configuration files and run the following command to initialize Terraform:
    ```
    terraform init
    ```

4. **Review Variables**: Open the `variables.tf` file and review the variables defined. Modify the values if necessary, or provide values using a `.tfvars` file.

5. **Plan Deployment**: Run the following command to see the execution plan for Terraform:
    ```
    terraform plan
    ```

6. **Deploy Infrastructure**: Once you've reviewed the plan and are satisfied with the changes, apply the Terraform configuration to deploy the infrastructure:
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

7. **Confirm Deployment**: Review the output of the Terraform apply command to confirm that the resources were created successfully. Make a note of any important information such as resource IDs or endpoints.

8. **Access Resources**: After deployment, you can access the deployed resources using the provided endpoints or AWS Management Console.

9. **Clean Up (Optional)**: If you no longer need the deployed resources, you can clean up by running:
    ```
    terraform destroy
    ```
   This command will destroy all the resources created by Terraform. **Note:** Be cautious when running destroy in production environments.
